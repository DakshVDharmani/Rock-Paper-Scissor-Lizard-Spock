## ðŸŽ® How to Play

The rules are simple â€” each choice beats two other choices and loses to two others:

| Choice   | Beats                       | Loses To                   |
|----------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Rock     | Scissors, Lizard            | Paper, Spock                |
| Paper    | Rock, Spock                 | Scissors, Lizard            |
| Scissors | Paper, Lizard               | Rock, Spock                 |
| Lizard   | Spock, Paper                | Rock, Scissors              |
| Spock    | Rock, Scissors              | Paper, Lizard               |
